Low footprint `no_std` World Magnetic Model (WMM) library used to calculate the magnetic declination at sea level.

It's important to note that the current model is valid from 2020 until 2025.

## Example

```rust
use time::OffsetDateTime;
use wmm::declination;

fn main() {
    let date = OffsetDateTime::now_utc().date();
    let lat = 29.7363025;
    let lon = -93.8827939;
    let dec = declination(date, lat, lon).unwrap();

    println!(
        "Today's declination for coordinates {},{} is {}Â°",
        lat, lon, dec
    )
}
```
